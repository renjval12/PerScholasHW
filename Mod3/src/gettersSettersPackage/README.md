## Getter & Setter Methods / Computer: 


- Create a Computer class that has 3 variables. The first variable will have a name. The second variable will be the year of the computer. Last variable will be the cost of the computer.

- All 3 variables should be private instance variables and must use getters to retrieve the data and setters to set the variables.
