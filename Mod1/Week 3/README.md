# Functions

## Instructions
Please write code that implements various functions, following the requirements in the list below:

- Define a function maxOfTwoNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. 
- Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
- Write a function isCharacterAVowel that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
- Define a function sumArray and a function multiplyArray that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. 
    - For example, sumArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiplyArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.
- Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
- Define a function reverseString that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
- Write a function findLongestWord that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
- Write a function filterLongWords that takes an array of words and a number i and returns the array of words that are longer than i characters long.

### BONUS: 

Convert as many of the functions above into one-line arrow functions (which means no curly brackets and no explicit use of the return keyword)

Example:

Turn...

    function sum(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2
    }

Into...

    const sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2
